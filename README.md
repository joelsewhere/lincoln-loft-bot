# The Lincoln Loft Bot

[The Lincoln Loft](http://www.thelincolnloft.com/) was founded in 2011 with the intention of making theater more accessible & less cost-prohibitive. It is a live/work theatrical space in Chicago that houses 8 resident artists at any given time. 

In 2020, a discord channel was created for resident artists to improve community organizing and collaboration. 

This project introduces automation in the form of a discord bot that ensures a consistent onboarding process for new resident artists.
